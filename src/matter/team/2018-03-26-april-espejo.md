  Born and raised in South Pasadena, CA, Edith has been dancing since she was 4
  years old. Her mother, the director of Raices Peruanas, is from Piura, Peru
  and her father is from Cusco, Peru. She has a background in environmental
  biology and social media management. She loves the way dancing traditional
  Peruvian dance connects her to her roots and teaches her more about Peruvian
  traditions and cultures.
