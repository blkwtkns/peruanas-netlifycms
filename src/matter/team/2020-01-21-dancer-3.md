about: >-
  Both of Brian's parents are from La Paz, Bolivia, he became interested in
  dancing when a Bolivian folkloric group based in Orange County invited him to
  watch them practice, allowing him to really immerse himself in his culture
  like never before. Through his performances with that dance group, his path
  crossed with Raices Peruanas and they were invited him to dance with them.
  Having learned from that his grandmother was from Peru, he decided to also
  explore those roots and has been loving it ever since.
