about: >-


  Born and raised in Los Angeles, CA, Fernando's dad immigrated from Iquitos,
  Peru and his mother from Lima, Peru. As a Peruvian-American, he has always had
  an interest and urge to dance to Peruvian music. He says the rhythm, the fun,
  and the excitement of dancing in a traditional Peruvian dance group really
  unites and ignites our individual passion for the arts.
