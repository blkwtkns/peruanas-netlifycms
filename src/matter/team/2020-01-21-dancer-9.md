  Born in Lima, Peru and raised in Northern California, Oscar started dancing

  competitions over the years. After high school he spent 3 years as the interim
  Artistic Director of the Peruvian dance group, "Asociaci√≥n Cultural Kanchis".
  Since moving to Los Angeles in 2007 he has been participating as a dancer and
