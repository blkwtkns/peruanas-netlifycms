about: >-
  Born and raised in Los Angeles, CA, he joined Raices Peruanas back when he was
  just 14 years old. His dad is from Iquitos, Peru and his mother is from Lima,
  Peru. As a Peruvian-American, he has always had an interest and urge to dance
  to Peruvian music. He says the rhythm, the fun, and the excitement of dancing
  in a traditional Peruvian dance group really unites and ignites our individual
  passion for the arts.
