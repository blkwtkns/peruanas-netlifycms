about: >-


  He was born in Los Angeles, CA and raised in Miami, FL by Puerto Rican
  parents. He has had a passion for dance since he was 5 years old. He grew up
  dancing salsa, merengue, and bachata, to name of few dance styles, as a kid.
  As he continued to expand his art form, he decided to learn Peruvian
  Folklorico. He states that Raices Peruanas has been the foundation of his
  success in his career of traditional Peruvian dance. He is grateful for the
  new music, dance moves, rhythm, and culture he has learned with the group.
