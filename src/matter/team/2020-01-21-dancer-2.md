about: >-


  Born in from Huancayo, Peru, Angela's mom is Huancaina and her dad is
  Ayacuchano. Because of this mix, Andean culture was very present in her life
  growing up. When she arrived to the U.S. she felt that something was missing
  because of the lack of Peruvian culture around her. Dancing with Raices
  Peruanas makes her feel close to her friends and family that she left in Peru.
  She says dancing fills her with joy and makes her miss Peru a little less
  while feeling also proud to represent her culture abroad.
